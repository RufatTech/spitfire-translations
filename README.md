# Translations
- This repository is created to add and improve multiple language support of the [Rookie Spitfire Bot](https://rookie-spitfire.cf)
- You can add/edit any language you want to improve, fix the existing languages.
- Do **NOT** change the words in [] brackets. They are variables handled by the program.
- Do **NOT** change "name" keys in commandData array. For example, { "name": "help", "localizedName": "help" } you must change localizedName here, not name.
- Create a pull request, say what you changed and I will look into it. You can also add your Discord username to description to get a role in the [support server](https://discord.gg/HzRw297nRR)
